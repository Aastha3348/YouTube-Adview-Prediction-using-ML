# YouTube-Adview-Prediction-using-ML
I worked on this Live project while working as a Machine Learning Intern at Internship Studio powered by national Engineering Olympiad 3.0.

## Machine Learning
  - As Machine Learning continues to emerge as a popular study there's a high rush among people in Technical field especially students to build their career in this field.
  - Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being
    explicitly programmed. 
  - Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.
  - Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers. 
  - The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning.

## About the Project:
  - Youtube advertisers pay content creators based on adviews and clicks for the goods and services being marketed. 
  - They want to estimate the adview based on other metrics like comments, likes etc. 
  - The problem statement is therefore to train various ML models and choose the best one to predict the number of adviews. 
  - The data needs to be refined and cleaned before feeding in the algorithms for better results.

## Dataset:
  - The file train.csv contains metrics and other details of about 15000 youtube videos. 
  - The metrics include number of views, likes, dislikes, comments and apart from that published date, duration and category are also included. 
  - The train.csv file also contains the metric number of adviews which is our target variable for prediction.

## Task:
  - Build a machine learning model which will predict youtube adview count based on other youtube metrics.

 ## Python Library used :
 ### Matplotlib
 - Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. 
 - It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK.
 
             $ pip install matplotlib
             
 ### NumPy
 - NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
 
             $ pip install numpy
             
 ### Pandas
 - pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. 
 - In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. 
 - It is free software released under the three-clause BSD license.
 - 
             $ pip install pandas

 ## Languages used :
 ### Python
  - Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language.
  - Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
  - Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.
  - It is similar to English as the complications of writing the code is very less compared to other languages.
  - A 4 line printing code in Java can be done in 1 line in Python.
  - It can be used for other types of programming and software development besides web development
 ### Jupyter Notebook
  - The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
  - Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.
